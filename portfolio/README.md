# Portfolio Service (SoulScout v1.1)

This service is responsible for tracking Solana wallets, calculating portfolio value, and persisting snapshots. It listens for commands on a Redis stream and publishes replies.

**Host OS Note:** This service is designed to be built and run inside Docker. The developer's host OS is Bazzite Linux (Fedora-based), and no `apt` commands are needed on the host. All dependencies are handled within the Docker image.

## Responsibilities

-   Handles commands: `/balance`, `/holdings`, `/add_wallet`, `/remove_wallet`.
-   Calculates portfolio value in USD based on the v1.1 valuation policy.
-   Persists portfolio snapshots and holding details to a PostgreSQL database.
-   Publishes replies to the `tg_gateway` via a Redis stream.
-   Provides a `GET /health` endpoint for container health checks.
-   **Does not** handle private keys or sign transactions.

## Valuation Policy

Portfolio valuation follows a strict priority list:
1.  **CoinGecko**: If a token is listed, its official USD price is used (tag: `CG`).
2.  **DEX Liquidity**: If not on CoinGecko but has â‰¥ $75k liquidity on a major DEX (via Jupiter), the pool mid-price is used (tag: `DEX`).
3.  **Estimated Value**: If liquidity is between $25k and $75k, the value is estimated with a 50% haircut (tag: `EST_50`).
4.  **Not Priced**: Tokens with < $25k liquidity are considered illiquid, valued at N/A, and excluded from the total (tag: `NA`).

A note is always included in replies about how many tokens were excluded.
